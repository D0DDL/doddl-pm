# Sales & Traffic Backfill — Azure Container App Job Runbook

**For:** Jon — one operator, Azure Cloud Shell
**Where:** <https://shell.azure.com>
**Date written:** 2026-08-19
**Run this:** once per backfill range you want to run (the job is reusable — re-trigger with different `BACKFILL_*` env vars for a different range)

> This runs `connectors/scheduler/backfill_sales_traffic.py`
> (`python -m connectors.scheduler.backfill_sales_traffic`) as a standalone
> **Azure Container App Job** — not the scheduler's continuously-running
> Container App, and not a local background process. Local background
> processes on this machine have been killed by something outside our control
> three separate times during testing; that's the whole reason this exists as
> a Job instead.

## Before you start

**Scope, from the measured Step 1 tests (not assumptions):**

- 15 marketplaces (13 EU, 2 NA) × up to 108 days = up to 1,620 (marketplace, day) pairs for the full 2026-05-01→2026-08-16 range. Japan is permanently out of scope — `FE-JP` has no working credentials in Key Vault (confirmed live, not untested).
- EU and NA run as two parallel threads inside the one job replica — confirmed independent rate-limit buckets (Test 1b).
- **Deliberate pacing (default 65s between `createReport` calls) does NOT reliably avoid 429s** — measured 5/12 (42%) hit rate at a strict 65s gap (Test 1a). The job survives this via the same retry-with-backoff already proven in production (`_fetch_sales_traffic_day`), not via the pacing interval. Don't expect a faster wall-clock time by lowering `BACKFILL_PACE_SECONDS` — the evidence doesn't support that.
- **Revised time estimate: EU alone (1,404 of the 1,620 pairs) at the already-observed real-world ~3.7 min/pair ≈ ~87 hours (~3.6 days).** NA's 216 pairs run in parallel alongside EU and don't add to this, since wall time is `max(EU, NA)`, not the sum. This is well past the ~29 hours a naive 65s-floor calculation would suggest — flagged here so the timeout setting below isn't a surprise.
- **It is idempotent and resumable at any point**, including if it hits the job's own `--replica-timeout`. If that happens, it is not a failure — just start a new execution with the same `BACKFILL_START`/`BACKFILL_END`; `resume=True` picks up exactly where it left off (already proven locally, three times, across kills and one real crash).

**A real prerequisite this runbook assumes and does not itself perform:** the image at `doddlacr.azurecr.io/doddl-scheduler:latest` must actually contain `connectors/scheduler/backfill_sales_traffic.py`. That file was written and tested locally this session but has **not** been committed, pushed, or built into any image. Section A below rebuilds the image from the current `staging` checkout before creating the job, using the same `az acr build` mechanism as the original scheduler bootstrap (`infra/scheduler/bootstrap-corrected.md` Section C5) — so the file needs to be committed and pushed to `staging` (or otherwise present in whatever you check out in Cloud Shell) before you run Section A, or the build won't include it.

**On `--replica-timeout`'s actual ceiling:** Microsoft's own Container Apps Jobs documentation describes this setting ("the maximum time in seconds to wait for a replica to complete") without stating a hard maximum in what I could fetch. This runbook sets it to `86400` (24 hours) as a reasonably high value, not a confirmed-safe maximum — if `az containerapp job create` rejects it as too high, back it off and expect to re-trigger the job more than once for a full-range backfill, which is fine given the resumability above.

---

## Section A — Rebuild the image with the new orchestrator file

```bash
RESOURCE_GROUP="doddl-ai-os-production"
ACR_NAME="doddlacr"
IMAGE_NAME="doddl-scheduler"
CONTAINER_APP_ENV="doddl-scheduler-env"
KEYVAULT_NAME="doddl-kv-prod"
JOB_NAME="doddl-backfill-sales-traffic"

cd ~
rm -rf doddl-pm
git clone https://github.com/D0DDL/doddl-pm
cd doddl-pm
git checkout staging
ls connectors/scheduler/backfill_sales_traffic.py

az acr build \
  --registry "$ACR_NAME" \
  --image "$IMAGE_NAME:latest" \
  --file connectors/Dockerfile \
  .
```

**What this does:** Same checkout-and-build pattern as the original bootstrap (Section A/C5 of `bootstrap-corrected.md`), rebuilding `doddlacr.azurecr.io/doddl-scheduler:latest` from whatever is currently on `staging`.

**Success looks like:** `ls` prints `connectors/scheduler/backfill_sales_traffic.py` (confirms the file is actually in this checkout — **if this errors, stop, the file hasn't been pushed yet**), then `az acr build` ends with `Run ID: ... was successful after ...`.

---

## Section B — Create the job

```bash
CONTAINER_APP_ENV_ID=$(az containerapp env show \
  --name "$CONTAINER_APP_ENV" --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --query id -o tsv)
ACR_LOGIN_SERVER=$(az acr show --name "$ACR_NAME" --query loginServer -o tsv)

az containerapp job create \
  --name "$JOB_NAME" \
  --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --environment "$CONTAINER_APP_ENV_ID" \
  --trigger-type "Manual" \
  --replica-timeout 86400 \
  --replica-retry-limit 0 \
  --replica-completion-count 1 \
  --parallelism 1 \
  --image "$ACR_LOGIN_SERVER/$IMAGE_NAME:latest" \
  --registry-server "$ACR_LOGIN_SERVER" \
  --registry-identity system \
  --cpu 0.5 --memory 1.0Gi \
  --command "python" "-m" "connectors.scheduler.backfill_sales_traffic" \
  --env-vars "AZURE_KEYVAULT_URI=https://doddl-kv-prod.vault.azure.net/" \
  --tags project=doddl-ai-os environment=production purpose=sales-traffic-backfill
```

**What this does:**

- `--environment` points the job at the **same** Container Apps Environment the scheduler app runs in — this is what gives it the same VNet/subnet (`doddl-scheduler-vnet` / `scheduler-infra-subnet`) automatically, since VNet integration is an environment-level setting, not a per-app one. No separate VNet configuration needed.
- `--trigger-type Manual`, `--replica-retry-limit 0`: Azure won't auto-retry a failed/timed-out execution. This is deliberate, per spec — the job is internally resumable; an automatic retry would just start over and burn time re-checking already-`ok` days instead of you deciding when to re-trigger.
- `--replica-timeout 86400`: see the caveat above.
- `--registry-identity system`: gives the job its **own** system-assigned managed identity (distinct from the scheduler app's — identities aren't shared across resources this way). Section C grants it Key Vault access separately.
- `--command`: overrides the image's default `CMD ["python", "-m", "connectors.scheduler.scheduler"]` to run the orchestrator instead.
- **Deliberately no `BACKFILL_START`/`BACKFILL_END`/`BACKFILL_MARKETPLACES` here** — those are supplied per-execution in Section D, not baked into the job definition, so the same job can be re-triggered for different ranges without recreating it. `AZURE_KEYVAULT_URI` is baked in since it never changes.
- No `AZURE_TENANT_ID` — deliberately absent, matching the scheduler app's existing configuration and the documented reason (`reports/scheduler-deploy-prep.md`): with it absent, `DefaultAzureCredential` resolves cleanly via `ManagedIdentityCredential` in a headless container; with it present, a failed managed-identity lookup falls through to an interactive browser credential that can't succeed here.

**Success looks like:** JSON ending `"provisioningState": "Succeeded"`.

---

## Section C — Grant the job's identity Key Vault access

```bash
JOB_PRINCIPAL=$(az containerapp job show \
  --name "$JOB_NAME" --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --query "identity.principalId" -o tsv)
echo "JOB_PRINCIPAL = $JOB_PRINCIPAL"

az keyvault set-policy \
  --name "$KEYVAULT_NAME" \
  --object-id "$JOB_PRINCIPAL" \
  --secret-permissions get list
```

**What this does:** Same grant as Section D of the original scheduler bootstrap, for this job's own identity — `doddl-kv-prod` uses access policies, not RBAC (confirmed in that runbook), so this is the call that actually matters, not a role assignment.

**Success looks like:** `JOB_PRINCIPAL = ` followed by a GUID, then JSON ending `"provisioningState": "Succeeded"`.

**No Key Vault firewall change needed here** — the job shares the scheduler environment's VNet (Section B), and that VNet's subnet is already in `doddl-kv-prod`'s `virtual_network_rules` (confirmed present, untouched, throughout this session's local firewall changes).

---

## Section D — Start an execution

```bash
az containerapp job start \
  --name "$JOB_NAME" --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --yaml - <<'EOF'
containers:
- name: main
  image: doddlacr.azurecr.io/doddl-scheduler:latest
  command: ["python", "-m", "connectors.scheduler.backfill_sales_traffic"]
  resources:
    cpu: 0.5
    memory: 1.0Gi
  env:
  - name: AZURE_KEYVAULT_URI
    value: "https://doddl-kv-prod.vault.azure.net/"
  - name: BACKFILL_START
    value: "2026-05-01"
  - name: BACKFILL_END
    value: "2026-08-16"
EOF
```

**What this does:** Starts one execution with `BACKFILL_START`/`BACKFILL_END` overridden for this run — per-execution overrides replace the whole template for that execution only (per Microsoft's docs: "the job's entire template configuration is replaced," which is why `AZURE_KEYVAULT_URI`, image, command, and resources are repeated here even though they're already on the job definition).

`BACKFILL_MARKETPLACES` is deliberately omitted — defaults to `ACTIVE_MARKETPLACES` (all 15). To backfill a subset instead, add e.g.:
```yaml
  - name: BACKFILL_MARKETPLACES
    value: "A1F83G8C2ARO7P,A1PA6795UKMFR9"
```

To resume after a timeout or a manual stop, run this **exact same command again unchanged** — `resume=True` is not a flag you set, it's how `run_sales_traffic_backfill`/`_fetch_sales_traffic_day` already work.

**Success looks like:** the command returns without error and prints the started execution's name.

---

## Section E — Watch progress and read logs

```bash
az containerapp job execution list \
  --name "$JOB_NAME" --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --query "[].{name:name, status:properties.status, start:properties.startTime}" -o table
```

**Success looks like:** one row, `status` moving `Running` → `Succeeded` (or `Failed`/`Stopped` if it hit the timeout — see "if something goes wrong" below).

**Read logs** (the orchestrator's own progress lines — `amazon_sp_backfill: DONE account=... marketplace=... date=... rows=... | N of M pairs complete, X% done, est. Yh remaining` — appear here):

```bash
az containerapp job logs show \
  --name "$JOB_NAME" --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" --follow
```

If that command isn't available in your CLI version, use the portal instead: **portal.azure.com → Container Apps Jobs → doddl-backfill-sales-traffic → Execution history → (execution) → Console logs**, matching the fallback the original scheduler runbook uses for the same reason.

## If something goes wrong

| What you see | What it means | Do |
|---|---|---|
| Execution status `Failed` almost immediately, no `PLAN:` log line | `BACKFILL_START`/`BACKFILL_END` missing or malformed, or `BACKFILL_MARKETPLACES` contains an unknown marketplace_id | The orchestrator calls `SystemExit` with a specific message for both — read the log, fix the YAML in Section D, re-run |
| `amazon_sp_backfill: account=... — no token obtainable, skipping this account entirely` | That account's refresh token secret is missing/wrong in Key Vault | Same as the FE-JP finding this session — check the secret exists before assuming it's a job-config problem |
| Execution status `Failed`/`Stopped` after running for a long time, no Python traceback in the logs | Hit `--replica-timeout` (86400s) | **Not a failure to fix — expected for the full range.** Re-run Section D unchanged; resume picks up where it left off |
| A Python traceback in the logs | An actual unhandled exception — the known ones (bad upsert values, AccountSkipped) are already caught inside `_fetch_sales_traffic_day`/this orchestrator, so a traceback here is a *new* failure mode, not one already covered | Read the traceback, it's the real cause — don't assume it's the timeout |
| `Client address is not authorized` / `ForbiddenByFirewall` on a Key Vault call | The job's outbound path isn't actually covered by the VNet rule (e.g., wrong environment was used in Section B) | Re-check Section B used the *same* `$CONTAINER_APP_ENV` as the scheduler app, not a new one |

**Re-running is always safe** — same reasoning as the original scheduler bootstrap: nothing here deletes anything, and `resume=True` means re-triggering never duplicates work, it only continues it.
