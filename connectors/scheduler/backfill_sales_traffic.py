"""
Standalone, resumable multi-marketplace backfill orchestrator for
GET_SALES_AND_TRAFFIC_REPORT. Not part of the scheduler's registered jobs.

Run as:
    python -m connectors.scheduler.backfill_sales_traffic

Required environment variables:
    BACKFILL_START          YYYY-MM-DD, required, no default
    BACKFILL_END            YYYY-MM-DD, required, no default (inclusive)
Optional:
    BACKFILL_MARKETPLACES   comma-separated marketplace_id list; defaults to
                             ACTIVE_MARKETPLACES (15: 13 EU, 2 NA — see
                             connectors/scheduler/jobs/amazon_sp_api.py)
    BACKFILL_PACE_SECONDS   minimum seconds between createReport call starts,
                             per account. Default 65.
    BACKFILL_REVERSE        true/false. When true (default), each marketplace's
                             pending days are processed newest-first instead of
                             oldest-first, so recent data lands early in a long
                             run instead of at the end. Purely an ordering
                             change — does not affect resume/skip logic, which
                             is keyed by (marketplace_id, date) regardless of
                             visit order.

Built 2026-08-19 on two MEASURED findings, not assumptions (see
reports/amazon-reports-api.md for the full test output):

  - Account-level rate-limit buckets are independent (Test 1b, confirmed live:
    EU and NA createReport calls fired simultaneously, both succeeded, zero
    429 interference). This orchestrator runs one thread per account, in
    parallel — safe, not a guess.

  - Deliberate fixed-interval pacing on createReport does NOT reliably avoid
    429s (Test 1a, confirmed live: 12 single-day UK requests at a strict,
    disciplined 65s gap between call starts still hit 429 on 5/12 = 42% of
    them, in two separate clusters — the second cluster appeared again after
    three clean successes, which argues against this being purely leftover
    burst depletion from earlier test activity in the same session).
    BACKFILL_PACE_SECONDS is still applied, configurable, default 65s, per
    spec — but it is a courtesy that reduces load, NOT a guarantee against
    429s. The thing that actually makes this survive 429s is the
    retry-with-backoff already built into _fetch_sales_traffic_day (5
    attempts, Retry-After-aware, 60s default backoff) — untouched here,
    reused exactly as it already exists and has been proven across multiple
    live production runs. Do not tune BACKFILL_PACE_SECONDS down expecting
    fewer retries; the measured evidence doesn't support that expectation.

Deliberately thin, deliberately tightly coupled to
connectors.scheduler.jobs.amazon_sp_api's internals rather than duplicating
its resume/retry/upsert-failure logic (including two underscore-prefixed
"private" helpers, _resume_skip_info and _fetch_sales_traffic_day) — that
logic is already tested and has already run in production against this exact
report type. Calls _fetch_sales_traffic_day directly rather than the
higher-level run_sales_traffic_backfill for two reasons: (1) it returns
(row_count, skipped_count) per day, which run_sales_traffic_backfill only
logs internally and does not return — needed for the progress line this file
is required to print; (2) it lets one token/httpx.Client/rate-limiter be
shared across an ENTIRE account's marketplace list (all 13 EU markets, or
both NA markets), not re-created per marketplace or per day, which
run_sales_traffic_backfill does on every call since it's designed as a
single-marketplace entry point.

No new columns, no new tables, no schema changes — writes go through the
exact same amazon_asin_daily / amazon_asin_daily_status path as
run_sales_traffic_nightly / run_sales_traffic_backfill already use.
